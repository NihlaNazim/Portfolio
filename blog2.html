            <p>As a computer science student, my first steps into web development opened up an amazing new world. 
                Starting with HTML and CSS felt like learning to paint on a digital canvas. </p>
            <p>I began with simple things - creating my first webpage with just a header and some paragraphs, then 
                gradually learning to style them with CSS.One of my proudest moments was building my first responsive website. 
                Seeing my page adapt perfectly to both desktop and mobile screens made all the late-night debugging sessions worth it. 
            <p>Currently, I'm exploring JavaScript and enjoying how it brings interactivity to my websites.</p>
                Through this journey, I've learned that web development isn't just about writing code â€“ it's about creating experiences 
                that people can use and enjoy. I'm excited to keep learning and building more projects that solve real problems.</p>
